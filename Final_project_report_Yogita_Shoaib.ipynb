However, they have two fundamental limitations:\n","  1. They cannot answer questions about events that happened after their training.\n","  2. They struggle to memorize knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus.\n","\n","* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solves these issues by incorporating relevant information into the LLM's context. RAG involves retrieving relevant passages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM.\n","\n","* Evaluating RAG systems is challenging due to the absence of reliable evaluation metrics. Traditional methods like perplexity or question-answering datasets with short extractive answers may not be representative of how the system will be used in practice.\n","\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### AIM:\n","\n","* The aim of the paper is to develop an efficient framework for evaluating RAG systems, particularly in scenarios where ground truth data is limited. \n","\n","* RAGAS aims to provide insights into the performance of RAG systems by offering a suite of metrics that can estimate different proxies for correctness and assess the usefulness of retrieved passages.\n","\n","* The framework focuses on providing automated, reference-free evaluation metrics that don't rely on human annotations or ground truth answers.\n","\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### Github Repo of orignal code:\n","Link: https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas\n","\n","#### Github Repo of our version:\n","Link: https://github.com/shoaibk99/Machine-Learning-Programming-Final\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n","\n","* The paper introduces RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a framework designed to automate the assessment of RAG systems.\n","\n","* It focuses on scenarios where reference answers are unavailable and aims to provide measures for three key aspects:\n","  1. Faithfulness: Ensuring the answer is grounded in the retrieved context\n","  2. Answer Relevance: Assessing if the answer addresses the actual question\n","  3. Context Relevance: Evaluating if the retrieved context is focused and contains minimal irrelevant information\n","\n","* The paper also introduces WikiEval, a new dataset with human judgments on these three aspects, to support the development and evaluation of such frameworks.\n","\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### PROBLEM STATEMENT:\n","\n","* Although RAGAS provides a solution for RAG evaluation, it does so by depending on major LLM providers like OpenAI.\n","\n","* It requires an API key provided by the same LLM provider, which can be quite expensive.\n","\n","* Moreover, it gives users less control over the evaluation model.\n","\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n","\n","* RAG systems are becoming increasingly important for integrating up-to-date and specialized knowledge with LLMs.\n","\n","* Effective evaluation of RAG systems is crucial for their development and deployment in real-world applications.\n","\n","* Current evaluation methods often rely on task-specific metrics or require extensive human annotations, which can be time-consuming and expensive.\n","\n","* There's a need for automated, general-purpose evaluation metrics that can provide quick feedback during the development cycle of RAG systems.\n","\n","*********************************************************************************************************************\n","#### SOLUTION:\n","\n","* Implement a version of the RAGAS model using other open-source models from HuggingFace.\n","\n","* This approach will solve the issue of requiring paid API keys for RAG evaluation.\n","\n","* It will provide users with more control over the evaluation model and allow for customization based on specific needs.\n","\n","* Using open-source models can make the evaluation process more transparent and accessible to a wider range of researchers and developers.\n","\n","* This solution aligns with the original RAGAS framework's goals while addressing the limitations of relying on proprietary LLM APIs."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"77PIPLQ-h-j1"},"source":["# Background\n","*********************************************************************************************************************"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"deODH3tMh-j2"},"source":["### Implement paper code :"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install ragas"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","from datasets import Dataset\n","import os\n","from ragas import evaluate\n","from ragas.metrics import faithfulness, answer_correctness\n","\n","os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"open api key\"\n","\n","covid_information_bot_dataset = {\n","    'question': [\n","        'What are common symptoms of COVID-19?',\n","        'How does COVID-19 spread?',\n","        'Can COVID-19 be cured by antibiotics?',\n","        'What is the incubation period for COVID-19?',\n","        'Do masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19?'\n","    ],\n","    'answer': [\n","        'Common symptoms of COVID-19 include headache and rash.',\n","        'COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.',\n","        'Yes, COVID-19 can be cured by antibiotics.',\n","        'The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 14-21 days.',\n","        'No, masks do not help in preventing the spread of COVID-19.'\n","    ],\n","    'contexts': [\n","        [\n","            'Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
